This repository implements the two-player card game 'The fox in the forest'. Two interfaces are provided: a command-line interface and a streamlit app. 
The command-line interface can be used by running play.py, while the streamlit app can be started by running 'streamlit run play_streamlit.py' from the terminal.
Currently only a computer opponent that plays random moves is implemented.
